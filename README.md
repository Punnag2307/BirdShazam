# BirdShazam – Acoustic Bird Species Identifier
BirdShazam is a machine learning-based audio classification system that identifies bird species from soundscape recordings. Designed for ecological research and conservation, it leverages MFCC feature extraction and transformer-based models to detect multiple overlapping bird calls in noisy natural environments.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This repository presents a complete pipeline for identifying bird species from field recordings using deep learning. It includes:

🔹 Audio preprocessing and spectrogram generation

🔹 Multi-model classification using EfficientNet and custom CNNs

🔹 Inference on 81,000+ unlabeled soundscape samples

🔹 Support for rare and nocturnal bird species

🔹 Post-inference metrics and interpretability with Grad-CAM

## 📂 Dataset
🔹 Source: BirdCLEF 2024 Competition on Kaggle

🔹 Training Data: Field recordings of 181 bird species

🔹 Unlabeled Data: 81,000+ soundscape chunks

## Preprocessing:

🔹 Audio resampled to 32kHz

🔹 5s chunks extracted from long recordings

🔹 Mel Spectrograms generated (300×300 PNG)

🔹 Feature extraction: RMS, spectral flatness for nighttime detection

## 🧠 Models

🔹 General Classifier
Model: EfficientNet-B3
Trained on 25,000 balanced samples from 181 species


🔹 Nocturnal Species Model
Focus: 7 owl species
Input filtered using a binary night/day classifier
Achieved 91.74% accuracy, F1 = 0.86


🔹 Rare Species Model
Covers 58 underrepresented species
Oversampled training set (~12k samples)
Achieved 90% accuracy, F1 = 0.86


🔹 Multi-Label Model
Trained on synthetic mixed spectrograms
Handles overlapping species in the same audio
Macro F1 Score: 0.75, Precision: 0.85


## 🌀 Inference Pipeline
🔹 Input: 81,000 unlabeled spectrograms

🔹 Nighttime detection via binary classifier (RMS + flatness)

🔹 Routed through appropriate models: General / Rare / Nocturnal

🔹 Combined predictions saved to final_combined_predictions.csv

🔹 Output: 181-class probability distribution per 5s chunk
